# Repository for reservoir-induced stabilisation papers

This repository contains:
* Rust source code used to run all simulations, located in `code`
* A copy of the shorter paper itself, in `short-paper`
* Scripts to automatically reproduce both the running of simulations and generation of all figures in the shorter paper, in `short-paper-figure-code`
* A copy of the longer paper itself, in `long-paper`
* Scripts to automatically reproduce both the running of simulations and generation of all figures in the longer paper, in `long-paper-figure-code`
