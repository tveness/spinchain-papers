# Figure generation scripts

The code to generate each figure in the paper are included in the following
directories

The scripts are written in python, and the requirements are included in the
requirements.txt file.

In order to generate the data, a functioning installation of `sc`, from
https://github.com/tveness/spinchain , must be present in the path.

Each script has a few options accessible in an interactive menu: plot the data
(each figure comes with the data used in the paper), generate a small run of
data, generate the full data used in the project.
